Description: 
     This Package mainly focuses on Modified Toxicity Interval design proposed by Ji et al (2010) and and Ockham's Razor proposed by Guo et al (2016). Given a total number of patients treated by a drug and number of people experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities in any Oncology Clinical Trial, this Package will find out the Decision to Escalate/ Stay/ De-escalate with the Dose. This package will also be able to generate a table which will tell us about Dose Escalation Decisions given maximum number of patients treated by a Dose. In addition , this package will also produce a Plot of Unit Probability Mass, a function used in making the Decision Making Criteria for the above mentioned Design and the underlying Posterior Distribution Function.

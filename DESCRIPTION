Description: 
     This Package mainly focuses on Modified Toxicity Interval design proposed by Ji et al (2010)
     and and Ockham's Razor proposed by Guo et al (2016). Given a total number of patients treated by a drug and number of people experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities,
     this Package will find out the Decision to Escalate/ Stay/ De-escalate with the Dose. This package will also be able to generate a table which will tell us about Dose Escalation
     Decisions given maximum number of patients treated by a Dose.
